# Clash Modules

These are a collection of utility and system modules I made while developing Toontown: Corporate Clash's v1.3.0 update.

This is a **partial leak** of Clash's source code, but:
1. These are **exclusively** reusable modules that I developed myself, and therefore belong to me.
2. There is no critical server code nor dclass definitions. **This cannot be exploited by bad actors in any way.**
3. This is being released as **it is a benefit to the community -- not the opposite.**

I have no interest in being a part of the Toontown community past this point. Consider this my parting gift.

## What's included

This repository contains several modules that I developed myself. I have trimmed out a lot of content code that was made by other developers,
but little changes/fixes may have been missed.

I have made no effort to ensure this code will run standalone. Integrating it into other projects will be someone else's job.

Inside, you will find:
- A Panda3D cutscene editor, used for creating almost all of Corporate Clash's cinematics
- The system code for Clash's group tracker (it's pretty bad, lol)
- The system code for Clash's quest system
- The system code for Clash's boosters
- The system code for Hammerspace inventories (80% done as of two years ago)
- An extreme amount of utility files for developing Panda3D GUI
- Distributed Object Modifiers (used for Content Sync)
- Social Panel (minus Clubs), specifically as a GUI reference
- Accessory Placement Panel
- Ambient sound system
- Lava Lamps
- A lot of miscellaneous utility classes for Astron and Python

## Why?

Do you find it odd that Toontown is one of the only modding communities to completely hide their processes and tools from each other?

By releasing this code, it becomes more accessible for future Panda3D projects to replicate the successes of Corporate Clash.

To quote Sheriff Cranky: ["I base all of my actions on what I think will push Toontown forward, and at some point a decision has to be made if some of the stakeholders are missing"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Toontown/comments/egwsom/ive_left_the_toontown_ttr_team_heres_why/)

(And selfishly, I want work I spent two years of my life on to be useful for someone. I tried so, so god damn hard. Please leave me alone.)
